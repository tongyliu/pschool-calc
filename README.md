PowerSchool Grade Calculator

This is the source code for the PowerSchool grade calculator website that I created in 2013. The site was created as my final project for CS50x, an online version of Harvard's CS50 computer science course offered by edx.org.

The code is primarily PHP. It also uses the Bootstrap framework, jQuery, SimpleHTMLDom, and snippets of code from CS50x's PSET 7.
